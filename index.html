            <p class="sectionSubtag text-small">The pandemic is thought to have originated at a market selling wild
                 animals in China, throwing a spotlight on the global wildlife trade. The New York-based Wildlife
                  Conservation Society is urging governments to ban live animal markets, and stop illegal
                   trafficking and poaching of wild animals
                   In the wake of the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China introduced a ban on all farming and consumption of live wildlife, which is expected to become law later this year.

                   There are growing calls for countries around the world to ban “wet markets” – which sell live and 
                   dead animals for human consumption – to prevent future pandemics. Elizabeth Maruma Mrema, 
                   acting executive secretary of the UN Convention on Biological Diversity, and Jinfeng Zhou,
                    secretary general of the China Biodiversity Conservation and Green Development Foundation,
                     have added their voices to calls for authorities to make the ban on wildlife markets permanent.</p>

        <p class="sectionSubtag text-small">The coronavirus is a zoonotic disease, meaning it jumped from animals
             to humans. Now, it seems to be jumping back.

            A tiger at the Bronx Zoo tested positive for the coronavirus. It is thought the tiger, 
            named Nadia, along with six other big cats, were infected by an asymptomatic zoo keeper. 
            The cats have been showing symptoms, including a dry cough, since late March. Paul Calle,
             the chief vet at the zoo, told Reuters, “This is the first time that any of us know of anywhere
              in the world that a person infected the animal and the animal got sick.”

    <p class="sectionSubtag text-small">From Africa to Colombia, there have been reports of a rise in 
        poaching of endangered species as tourists stay away and many park rangers are left out of work.

        In Botswana, government workers have been evacuating black rhinos from the Okavango Delta after 
        six of the animals were reported to have been killed in March.
        
        In an statement, the Ministry of Environment, Natural Resources and Tourism said it was "very
         conscious that poachers may try to take advantage of the lockdown and the lack of movement by tourists in remote areas to carry out their illegal activities".
        
        In Colombia, there's been a spike in the poaching of wild cats including jaguars and pumas, 
        according to wildlife conservation organization Panthera, while in India, there have been reports 
        of a rise in tigers being poached.
        
        Matt Lewis, who leads Conservation International’s work on wildlife trafficking issues
         in Africa, says: “In Africa, there has been an alarming increase in bushmeat harvest and 
         wildlife trafficking that is directly linked to COVID-19-related lockdowns, decreased food 
         availability and damaged economies as a result of tourism collapses."</p>
